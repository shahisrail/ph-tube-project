      <h1 class="text-2xl text-center font-medium ">var</h1>
      <div>
        <li>Block Scope: Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block
          in which
          they are defined (e.g., within an if statement or loop).</li>
        <li>Hoisting: Like var, let variables are also hoisted, but they are not initialized with a value until their
          declaration
          statement is reached. Trying to use a let variable before declaration will result in a ReferenceError.</li>
        <li>No Global Property: Unlike var, let does not create properties on the global object (e.g., window in a
          browser).</li>
      </div>

    </div>
    <div>
      <h1 class="text-2xl text-center font-medium">const</h1>
      <div>
        <li>Function Scope: Variables declared with var are function-scoped. This means they are only accessible within
          the function
          in which they are defined.</li>
        <li>Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope.
          This means
          you can use a var variable before it's declared, but it will have an initial value of undefined.</li>
        <li>No Block Scope: Unlike let and const, var does not have block-level scope. It means a var variable declared
          within a
          block (like an if statement or a loop) is accessible outside that block.</li>
        <li>Global Scope: If a var variable is declared outside of any function or block, it becomes a global variable,
          accessible
          throughout the entire program.</li>

      <h1 class="text-2xl text-center font-medium">let</h1>
      <div>
        <li>Block Scope: Variables declared with const are also block-scoped, just like let.
        </li>
        <li>Constant Value: const variables must be assigned a value when declared, and once assigned, their value
          cannot be
          changed. This makes them suitable for defining constants.</li>
        <li>
          Hoisting: Like let, const variables are hoisted but are not initialized until their declaration statement is
          reached.
        </li>

        <li>Null is basically an assignment value given to a variable. The variable which has been assigned as null
          contains no
          value.</li>
        <li>Null in JavaScript means an empty value and is also a primitive type in JavaScript. The variable which has
          been assigned
          as null contains no value. Undefined, on the other hand, means the variable has been declared, but its value
          has not
          been assigned.</li>
